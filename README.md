The game we’ve brought you today is titled Unveiling Injustice. In this action-adventure game, the player enters this mysterious company overrun by ghosts that influence bad business practices over the employees. Your task is to fend off these ghosts and recruit allies to ultimately face off against the corrupt CEO who is behind everything.
